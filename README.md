# Site-adaptation
Solar irradiance and environmental data are provided by satellite and in-situ measurements. It is usual that satellite measurements present high temporal resolution with limited spatial resolution, and in-situ measurements provide high accuracy but significant missing data. This project proposes a methodology based on machine learning algorithms that takes the best of both data sources to obtain an improved spatio-temporal resolution, known as site-adaptation.
